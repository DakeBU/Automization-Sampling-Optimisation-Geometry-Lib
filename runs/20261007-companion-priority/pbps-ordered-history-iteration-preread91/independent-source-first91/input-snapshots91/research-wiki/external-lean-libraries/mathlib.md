# Mathlib

- Public site: https://mathlib-initiative.org/
- Local checkout searched by ASTIS: `.lake/packages/mathlib/Mathlib`
- Role: upstream target and first search surface for reusable SDE/Sampling
  technical lemmas.

ASTIS agents must search Mathlib before creating a generic local theorem.  If
Mathlib already has the result, ASTIS should prove only the narrow adapter
needed by the current project.  If ASTIS proves a clean generic theorem, the
leaf should be written so it can later be proposed upstream.
